            Electronic Valve Testing (EVT) is a state of the art system developed by Dresser

            efficiency for in-place testing of pressure relief valves. EVT is a comprehensive
            service package that caries the job from start to finish. Utilizing the latest
            computer technology, Dressers 2566 EVT provides a package that a Green Tag Center

            summary. There is no guesswork involved. In addition to determining set point a
            trained operator can also use the EVT to identify performance problems requiring
            disassembly and repair.
