                Electronic Valve Testing (EVT) is a state of the art system developed by Dresser
                and is available through Pioneer Industrial Corporation. It provides unparalleled
                efficiency for in-place testing of pressure relief valves. EVT is a comprehensive
                service package that caries the job from start to finish. Utilizing the latest
                computer technology, Dressers 2566 EVT provides a package that a Green Tag Center
                can use to analyze valves onsite and provides a computer printout with a detailed
                summary. There is no guesswork involved. In addition to determining set point a
                trained operator can also use the EVT to identify performance problems requiring
                disassembly and repair.
